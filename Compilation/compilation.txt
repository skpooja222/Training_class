Compilation Process

1) Complilation will transfer the source code into machine language
2) compilation has various steps which is listed below

a. Preprocesser-> The main function of the C preprocessor is to remove comments from the source code and
interpret preprocessor directives which are given by the statements that begin with #.

--> The first method tells the preprocessor to look for the file in the standard include directories,
which for Linux are in /usr/include.

b. Compiler and assembler
--> The compiler translates the C
code into assembly language, which is a machine level code that contains instructions that
manipulate the memory and processor directly, in a layer beneath the operating system.
Usually, you do not need to see the assembly code.


d. linker
The object file hello.o contains a binary version of the machine language that was created
from your source code hello.c

In order to create the executable hello or a.out, you need
to use the linker to process your main function and any possible input arguments you might
use, and link your program with other programs that contain functions that your program
uses
